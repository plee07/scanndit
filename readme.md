**GA Project 1 - Readme**

**Project Members: Davis Allen, Phil Lee**

---

**Explanations of the technologies used.**

>Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

**A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.**

> This project was developed using the DRY and KISS principle and therefore there was a heavy focus on modulaization. Both pair and individual programming were performed. The general template layout and file structure of the project was built together and the work was divided based on user stories. In order to keep the team working together they tackled different user stories from the same features. This allowed the members to independently work on a story but also forced them to have frequent meetings where they shared, discussed, and refactored their code into reusable components.


**Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.**

> **Delete Post** - unable to call the 'delete post by id' API (Unsolved)\

> **Transfering post details between pages** - When a user clicks on a post he will be directed to a comments page where a 'get comments by Post Id" will called.

> Managing user login state - One of the difficulty the team faced early on was maintaining a user's login state as they navigate to the different pages.

**A link to your user stories — who your users are, what they want, and why.**

> Our user base is your average everyday person who seeks a platform to communicate with others worldwide. A user is typically busy and do not have the time to learn how to use a product. Therefore, a minimalist approach was taken and the UI was built to be intutive for those with no prior knowledge of the app.\

**A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.**

> Note: This is our original wire frame and our final design has changed sligthly.
