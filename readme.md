**GA Project 1 - Readme**

**Project Members: Davis Allen, Phil Lee**

---

**Explanations of the technologies used.**

>Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

**A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.**

> This project was developed using the DRY and KISS principle and therefore there was a heavy focus on modulaization. Both pair and individual programming were performed. The general template layout and file structure of the project was built together and the work was divided based on user stories. In order to keep the team working together they tackled different user stories from the same features. This allowed the members to independently work on a story but also forced them to have frequent meetings where they shared, discussed, and refactored their code into reusable components.


**Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.**

> We've come across various bugs as we were navigating around our websites but we were able to troubleshoot. The major problem we faced was around maintaining the state of the user

**A link to your user stories — who your users are, what they want, and why.**

> Our user base is your average everyday person who seeks a platform to communicate with others worldwide. A user is typically busy and do not have the time to learn how to use a product. Therefore, we approached our web app with a minimialist mindset and kept everything as simple and intutive to use without any prior knowledge.

**A link to your wireframes — sketches of major views or interfaces in your application.**

> Note: This is our original wire frame and our final design has changed sligthly.
