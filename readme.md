**GA Project 1 - Readme**

**Project Members: Davis Allen, Phil Lee**

**Explanations of the technologies used.**

>Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. Our focus on this project was to primarily focus on vanilla JS and familiarize ourselves with API calls.

**A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.**

> We started this project with a focus on modulaization and DRY principle. We took both a pair programming and individual approach.

In order to keep us working together we didn't divide the work by features but by user stories on the same feature. This allowed us to work independently but also forced us to have hourly meetings where we shared, discussed, and refactored our code into reusable functions.   


**Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.**

> We've come across various bugs as we were navigating around our websites but we were able to troubleshoot. The major problem we faced was around maintaining the sstate of the user

**A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.**

**Installation instructions for any dependencies.**



**A link to your user stories — who your users are, what they want, and why.**

Our user base is the average everyday person who seeks a platform. As a user, we want a web app that is intiutive to use and therefore we kept our design simple and intuitive.
